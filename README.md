## TransportChain

A chainlink model that allows purchase of government transport passes based on volume present at different transport hubs.

Going after:

1. Government tech prize
2. Social impact prize.

## Inspiration

Covid caused a huge drop in public service usage that could be mitigated/reduced by offering the public the ability to pre-purchase futures for public transport on chainlink.

## What it does

- Uses chainlink oracles to model/track attendence at different airport and transportation hubs.
- Determines a real-time price for a given futures contract

## How we built it

- GeoDB

## Challenges we ran into

Integrating the different technologies.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for Transport Chain
